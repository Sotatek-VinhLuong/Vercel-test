## Rate Limits

Blocklens API has rate limit mechanism placed on each of the Blocklens API offered. Depending on the [plans](https://docsblocklens.readme.io/reference/pricing) that you have on your Blocklens account, you will have different throughput which will determine how many API calls you can make before getting rate limiteds.
