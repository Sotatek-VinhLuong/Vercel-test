# Dashboard Layout

The Blocklens design is simplistic and straightforward.

- The Navigation Menu **on the top** holds controls for the Dashboard menu, Profile menu and the Pricing menu;
- Information displayed **in the center** of the Dashboard represents the contents and details of the specific functionality that’s selected.
- The first section of the Dashboard displays general statistics for your usage. Main data is displayed right **on the top** of the Dashboard section. There you can view information on Total Message, Total Activities, Success Rate in 24 hours and Active Webhook. Each user also has a **"User’s Graph"** section of the Dashboard showing the general number of usage.
- The **“Apps”** section is where users manage their apps and work with Webhooks.
